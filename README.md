# MAC-ErrorReads
MAC-ErrorReads is a Machine Learning-Assisted Classifier for Filtering Erroneous NGS Reads. It converts the process of filtering erroneous NGS reads into a machine learning classification problem. MAC-ErrorReads learns a mapping function F that transforms the input features space X extracted from each sequencing read into a binary label classification Y of this read as (1) for erroneous read and (0) for correct one.
