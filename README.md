# MAC-ErrorReads
MAC-ErrorReads is a Machine Learning-Assisted Classifier for Filtering Erroneous NGS Reads. It converts the process of filtering erroneous NGS reads into a machine learning classification problem. MAC-ErrorReads learns a mapping function F that transforms the input features space X extracted from each sequencing read into a binary label classification Y of this read as (1) for erroneous read and (0) for correct one.
# Usage


# Tools

# Data
we are using two different datasets.The first dataset used in our experiments is Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (E.coli) with RefSeq accession entry NC_000913. The second  dataset used in our experiments is S. aureus genome from the GAGE project.
