# MAC-ErrorReads
MAC-ErrorReads is a Machine Learning-Assisted Classifier for Filtering Erroneous NGS Reads. It converts the process of filtering erroneous NGS reads into a machine learning classification problem. MAC-ErrorReads learns a mapping function F that transforms the input features space X extracted from each sequencing read into a binary label classification Y of this read as (1) for erroneous read and (0) for correct one.
# Usage


# Tools
We are using different tools.

We used the wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim) simulator. Wgsim is a small tool for simulating sequence reads from a reference genome.

We also used the BWA aligner (https://github.com/lh3/bwa) to align the reads to the E. coli reference genome and extract their alignment scores from the resulting SAM files.

We also used Velvet assembler (https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet) to assemble the reads that are classified as error-free reads.

We also used QUAST (https://github.com/ablab/quast), the assembly evaluation tool, to evaluate the assembly results.

We are finally using Lighter (https://github.com/mourisl/Lighter), a KMER-based error correction method for genome sequencing data.We are using Lighter to correct the error reads.



# Data
We are using two different datasets.The first dataset used in our experiments is Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (E.coli) with RefSeq accession entry NC_000913. The second  dataset used in our experiments is S.aureus genome from the GAGE project. 

we are using simulated dataset to train our models . We used  wgsim simulator, which is included within the SAMtools for whole genome simulation, 
to test our modls we are using simulated and real dataset.

The link of the simulated datasets used (https://drive.google.com/file/d/10nEAroKXB9uUEFjL8eZ6tle8wr5GryzX/view?usp=drive_link) to train and test our models.

The first real dataset used with accession number SRR625891 and the second real dataset used in our experiments is S. aureus genome from the GAGE project
